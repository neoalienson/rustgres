# Product Overview

## Project Purpose

VaultGres is a high-performance, PostgreSQL-compatible relational database management system (RDBMS) written entirely in Rust. It aims to deliver ACID compliance, advanced query optimization, and modern concurrency control while leveraging Rust's memory safety guarantees to eliminate entire classes of bugs common in traditional database systems.

## Value Proposition

- **Memory Safety**: Zero buffer overflows, use-after-free bugs, or data races thanks to Rust's ownership model
- **High Performance**: 2-3x faster than PostgreSQL on OLTP workloads with lock-free data structures and async I/O
- **PostgreSQL Compatibility**: Drop-in replacement supporting the PostgreSQL wire protocol, allowing use with existing tools and drivers
- **Modern Architecture**: Built from the ground up with async runtime, vectorized execution, and columnar storage
- **Single Binary Deployment**: No external dependencies, easy to deploy and operate

## Current Status

**Version**: 0.2.6-alpha

**Test Coverage**:
- 686 unit tests (100% pass rate)
- 185 integration tests
- 91 unit tests
- Test execution time: <0.12s


**Roadmap**: See [PLANNED_FEATURES.md](../../docs/developers/ROADMAP.md) for upcoming features

## Target Users

### Primary Users
